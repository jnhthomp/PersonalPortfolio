Portfolio page for myself to allow potential employers/clients to learn more about me, my previous work, and skills. Also provides several methods of contact including social websites like LinkedIn and Github, my email, and a form which is available to me on the backend of the application. I also keep an up to date version of my resume hosted here on the site for anyone to access.

One interesting feature on here is the live github latest commit in the about me section. A lot of times this will be a daily coding challenge that I have done and allows those who visit to see what projects I am actively developing.
Clicking the commit message will take you to that commit in github so you can see exactly what changes I pushed last.

## Optimizations
I would like to convert this site to a React application, not necessarily because it needs to be, but because I like how modular React is. However, if I were to do that I know a lot of changes I would want to make to the point where it wouldn't be the same portfolio anymore.
